# Transcycle

Transcycle is a clock/sequencer module that is a combination of the Multicycle sequencer by WyrdAl and the Transport module derivered from Orhack by Audivit.

It has been modified to allow start and stop the clock by being on any other page except the main one. Stopping the clock will mess up the timing of the recorded sequences and they should be deleted. 
Swing has also been implemented but it does not effect the Multicycle sequences.
The main benefit is that is compatible with Overdrum and Overflow as part of the Orhack suite of sequencers.

Things to fix:
Global preset changes have not been implemented.
